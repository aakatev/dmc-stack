        <h1>Hi there,</h1>
        <p>and welcome to DMC stack, great solution for C and C++ developers seeking back-end solutions!</p>
        <p>DMC stack consists of Docker, Mongo, and Crow. Docker and Mongo are known to everyone, but what is Crow? It's C++ micro-framework, inspired by Flask. Although community support might not be that great, Crow allows you to do most part of development in C++. It also comes with its own implementation of Mustache, allowing for backend rendering. It supports websockets, and could be a great RESTful API for your client!</p>
        <p>DMC stack is easy to setup! Learn more on projects GitHub <a href="https://github.com/aakatev/dmc-stack">repo</a>, or official <a href="https://cpp-crow-server.herokuapp.com">website</a>.</p>
